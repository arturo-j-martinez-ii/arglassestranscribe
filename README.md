_**About This Project:**_

**AR Glasses** is a UTSA Quality of Life + Challenger Project being currently developed by  Arturo Martinez, a UTSA Top Scholar Electrical Engineering freshman.

The goal of this project is to develop a **universial transcription lens glasses attachment** that doesn't require Wi-Fi or a celluar device for a deaf and visually impaired veteran named Micheal and anyone to use.
